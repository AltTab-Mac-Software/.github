## What is AltTab Mac?

AltTab Mac is a productivity utility created for faster **[window switching](#)** on macOS. It enhances the standard app switcher by making it easier to move between applications and, importantly, between individual windows when you have many things open.

The experience is built around speed and clarity: see visual previews, identify the right window at a glance, and jump directly where you need to be. That makes **[application navigation](#)** more predictable during multitasking, especially for developers, designers, and anyone juggling multiple documents.

AltTab Mac helps reduce friction in daily work by turning constant switching into a smooth rhythm—less hunting, fewer wrong clicks, and faster context changes. It supports workflows where time is lost not in big tasks, but in the tiny transitions between them.

If you live in a multi-window environment, AltTab Mac provides a practical upgrade to macOS navigation, improving focus and **[productivity](#)** without changing how you already work.
